Welcome to skranger's documentation!
====================================

This package provides relatively minimal bindings for the C++ random forest implementation known as ``ranger``. The classifier and regressor classes are intended to be compatible with the ``sklearn`` API, and the survival class is closely compatible with the ``sksurv`` package API.
